       Reflection:  Entire Semester.
        <br><br>

        Critical Writing 
        <br><br>
        My least favourite about this semester, were the critical writings that we were given each week. In the beginning, when we started with Marshall McLuhan, I thought, “interesting, he was a man ahead of his time, he seems cool”. I generally enjoyed the reading and especially was intrigued by his notion of a global village, which essentially is what we have now. We have tribes and communities online, that form a important aspect of who we are in society. From there onwards, I supposed I started to lose interest slowly but surely, what is a browser and how does it work? This topic painfully reminded me of my IT theory course back in high school and that wasn’t even as bad, I just had to give 2 to 3 lines as an answer, and I would get the marks that I deserved. If there’s one thing, I realised from the different critical writings I’ve had to do this semester is that topics that don’t intrigue me often are the ones I score the lowest in. It’s quite difficult to speak about something you’re not really passionate about, or else it feels like you’re rambling and repeating the same ideas.
<br>
However, I couldn’t let that be an excuse as to why I was scoring so poorly. I made a choice to go back to some of my pieces and rewrite them and add more depth to them. One of them that I took for granted initially, was the critical writing I had to do for the topic, Internet, Society and Design Justice. At first, this seemed like another one of those topics where I’m really not interested in. However, when I went to do some additional research and actually sat down to reflect deeply on the issues discussed, I discovered that this was a topic I really liked. It’s true that the internet reflects the type of society that we live in. The racist comments, queerphobic and homophobic jokes, all stem from the realities of who people are. It was also interesting to discuss different ways that design justice can be achieved, the main point here being diversifying the web development and software development issues. In this way, the algorithms created can cater for more people of different backgrounds and not exclude anyone.
<br>
Overall, despite disliking some of the readings that needed to be done, I can’t dispute the fact that gained valuable knowledge from the critical writings that we had to do. I’m guessing that was the point. But, on the name of everything good, Hanli, please spare us these critical writings next semester, I don’t think I can handle such abuse anymore.
<br><br>
Creative Work
<br>
In the beginning of the semester, I started off with this project thinking I had no creative bone in my body, which Hanli thought the opposite. Seeing how far I’ve come, I can say that I have maybe a maximum of five creative bones in my body, which is definitely something to proud of, its better than zero. 
<br>
Looking at the entirety of my website, I am most proud of how the colour scheme actually works well together. It kind of reminds me of the feminine and masculine energy that I have residing within me, hence the pink and dark blue. I love that the Logo I used, describes some information about me, a black girl with a whole lot of magic.  What I wish I did, was include that in the about section. Initially, I had big plans for the about section, however, I came across issues like images not being the same size, therefore appearing weirdly when put within my image slider container. I thought about cropping images or resizing them to have the same dimensions, however, the quality of the picture really looked awful, so I left it as it is now. Despite the about section not saying a whole lot about me, such as age, school and other important aspects, it still contains certain crucial information about me, such as my hobbies, what I think of life, and the certain skills I acquire in relation to my profession. 
<br><br>
One thing I am satisfied with, is how I’ve communicated clearly and consistently with my users by setting expectations of behaviour. I achieved this by using the same layout in my blog page, style guide, and portfolio page. In this way, users know how to navigate through my site and know how to complete their tasks because they are familiar with the entire layout of the website, because of the similarities between different webpages. I thought this was a bonus for me, as user experience is a crucial part when developing websites.
<br>
Finally, to end of this section, I would like to point out places were I failed and would hope to improve in the near future. The biggest issue being the pages of my blog entries. I wish I could have more time to rearrange the way everything is structure on the page, because the structure of it right now, makes me want to yell in frustration because it does not look like a blog site at all. I tried to improve it, by getting rid of the coloured text and tiny font, in the hopes of making it more readable for users, but besides that improvement, I am still unhappy with the blog section. I’ve come to terms with the fact that, you win some and you lose some, and this section is definitely considered a loss. Nonetheless, I think in terms of creativity, I did not do too much of a bad job, there is always room for improvements though.


<br><br>
Technical Work
<br>
Throughout the semester I think I struggled with the technical side of this project the most. In the beginning I really struggled with the concepts of metadata tags and micro formatting. I was using the conventions that I had used in high school without knowing that a lot has changed over the years. I obviously lost a lot of marks in these areas because I wasn’t following the new conventions of Html. However, after finally grasping these concepts, I think I’ve done a good job at implementing them within my code, as one can see there are a lot less div tags used and more figures, section, article tags used. The only thing that I could not fix, which was on my to-do list, but because of the 2 other exams I have to do, I could not get it done. This is using br tags in my html elements for the style of paragraphs. I know this is wrong and had every intention of fixing it. I guess I'll just have to take the penalities for this one.
 <br>
 Another concept that I struggled with were Media Queries. I wasn’t too sure how they worked, until recently. I understood its function, but I was not totally sure how to correctly implement them within my own work. However, I’m proud to say that I finally grasped this concept and implemented it appropriately and now when I minimize my screen size, all the contents of my website fit accordingly depending on the screen size.

<br>
Looking back to the first project and this final version for the semester, there are a lot of issues that I have worked on upon recommendations from Andre. I’m hoping my back end is now consistent with the level of my front-end. There’s no point in having a website that has a good front-end but a horrible back end.  I’ve tried to follow as many conventions as possible when coding, such as using camelCase for JavaScript and using small letters for Html.
<br>
Speaking of JavaScript, this is still a new skill that I’m yet to master. In my project I’ve tried to stick to basic and vanilla JavaScript as I know where my strengths and weaknesses lies, and JavaScript is most definitely not one of my strengths. I am, however, proud of how I’ve implemented JavaScript to create my image slide, to help in terms of navigation, as well as to help me when customizing my Video.js player. All of this, in my opinion, is a great start for someone who doesn’t have much experience in JavaScript.
Overall, I think I’ve come a long way from the “web-developer” I was in the beginning of the semester to the “web-developer” that I am now. I only hope to see a continuous road of improvement..
