       Reflection: Second Assignment.
        <br><br>

   
        When I decided to take this course, I really had no idea what to expect because this was
        the first time I had ever taken an online class. Truthfully, I was not too concerned about the
        content of the course because I have worked with HTML before, and I had already developed static websites back in high school. The only difference between now and then are the conventions used now are more demanding than they were 8 years ago. There were so many new aspects introduced to me in the timeline between my first assignment and this assignment.
        <br>
        First of all, I had never really studied the design elements of web development. Because
        of my artistic background, many issues related to design were intuitive to me, such as colour
        scheme, consistency, and balanced usage of space. Still, I had never examined those issues
        extrinsically, and it was very helpful to discuss design matters in tangible terms. I also enjoyed
        and learned a lot from the process of examining good and bad examples of web site design.
        There have always been things that have annoyed me on the Internet, but I have never taken the
        time to identify what those things were and why they were annoying to me. By doing so, I was
        able to consciously avoid including bad design elements in my own site. I at least tried to avoid using bad design elements, unlucky for me, I am a slow learner ad it does take me a bit of time to finally get things right.
        <br>
        <br><br>
        CSS
        <br>
        Perhaps one of the most exciting things that I learned about in this class is Cascading
        Style Sheets. In fact, I am extremely anxious to learn more about them. I know that we just
        barely brushed the surface in this class, and even now I wanted to do more than was contained in
        the lecturers, so I looked up some other neat tricks on the Internet and experimented with what I
        could do. I was really excited about the use of the external style sheet because I could apply so
        many changes to my entire site at one time. When I was working on my final project, I spent
        hours tweaking the colour scheme. I changed the colours of the links at least a dozen times. That
        process would have taken me much longer if I had to apply my changes to each individual page.
        My external style sheet allowed me to trial and error to my heart’s content. Honestly, I just can’t
        wait to learn more about it. If there’s one thing that I’m most grateful about for this assignment, is that the website looks aesthetically pleasing, even if the back end might be a total disaster. It shows me that I can at least still do something right.
        
<br><br>
JavaScript
<br>
JavaScript is a scam. Yes, that’s right, I said it! When introduced to JavaScript earlier this semester, I thought, “ah not too bad, I can deal”, because the examples used in class were very basic and straight to the point. However, this all took a turn for the worse when I had to find a way to implement it for this assignment. Firstly, it was difficult deciding what I wanted to do with it and how it would fit in the context of my website. Eventually, I found a way to integrate it and create a slide show that shared information about myself, although I used images I originally did not want to use. Perhaps for the next assignment, if I have time, I can replace them with the images I originally thought of using and just make sure they all have the same dimensions as this was the problem I was facing.
I know I’m yet to bump into a whole lot of JavaScript, but I won’t lie this does not make me happy at all. In fact, it only makes me wonder how and why I was so excited to take this course in the first place. Oh right, I didn’t really like the other options available. However, I can’t just quit when the going gets tough, in the near future, preferably during a semester break, I would like to do more readings and research on JavaScript and broaden my knowledge on it. I feel that this would really help me with the upcoming assignments for this course.

<br> <br>
Critical Writing 
<br>
The readings given to us this term in order to reflect and write on, were somewhat interesting. Some of them I had the pleasure of reading and writing about like the “Information Geographies” and the analysis of my UI and UX. These two are definitely one of my longer pieces compared to the rest. Information Geographies really intrigued me because it was really interesting to see the divide between the Global North and South based on the provision of internet, and knowledge.

<br>
The aim of this article was to highlight the problem that large areas of the world face. Where the internet is not accessible to others than it is to some others. In addition to that, the aim was to graphically show the disproportion in digital information access, and this came with maps to convey a better and simpler to understand to readers. The result of geographic information emerging has come with its consequences, good and bad. An example of it is how geographic information can represent certain spaces, as well as not represent other spaces correctly or at all. . I will be delving into the three important topics explored in this article. Geographies of Access and Enablement, Geographies of Participation, and Geographies of Representation

<br>
The UI and UX critical writing were actually a lot of fun for me. This is because I was taking concepts and applying them to my own unique website. Through the concepts, I realised certain things that I did well to improve the UI and UX of my website, and also realised certain things I was lacking or just did not execute as desired. There are definitely a whole lot of things that I can add in regard to polishing up my UI and UX, but that’s a work in progress and I believe I will improve on them over time.

<br><br>
Internet, Society and Design Justice.

<br>

I’ll be honest and say that I didn’t really enjoy the readings that accompanied this topic. I’m sure everyone’s aware that the internet has its positives and negatives, like everything else in this world. That’s the same with our society, we have good people, and we have bad people and that’s okay. The only responsibility I have as an internet user is follow the internet etiquette which I learnt about in grade 8 and just not cause problems for anyone. What someone else does in their own space and time is completely their business and none of mine. Hence, why I rarely paid attention to this topic as I didn’t find it intriguing as the others. However, I really got to think about the whole design justice aspect of this topic. I’m an advocate for equality and justice, no matter where I go. I thought perhaps I should have written more on that aspect, because the internet can really be an ugly place for people who are considered the “minority”. A lot of racism and sexism, queerphobia and homophobic comments are said and done online. The first principle of Design justice network entails that we use design to sustain, heal and empower our communities as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems. Looking back, I think I could have said a lot more in that section and build a strong argument if I wasn’t so stuck up on complaining about all the writings we’ve had to do. Perhaps, I’ll look at that a little more deeply for the next submission.

Developemtn of Website so far
<br><br>
Styling 
<br>
I am pleased with the dark blue and pink colour scheme I have going on, as those two are my primary colours and I feel that they compliment each other so well. I think they give the entire site at a sense of creativity which should be saying something about the designer herself. 

In addition to that, I am pleased that the colour of the nav bar has changed from the colour blue to white now, I like that it stands out, hopefully catching the eyes of users who visit the site, letting them know that that’s the nav bar and it will always be something useful to them. Speaking of the nav-bar, I feel that this could still use a lot of work, such as making it stay visible to the users even if the users scroll down to the bottom. I also need to work on the technical aspect of the nav bar, making sure it is navigated using JavaScript, whatever that means. That’s something I’ll have to work on some other day.

<br> <br>
Structure of Website
<br>
Overall, I’m pleased with how the website is structured. The blog page, style guide and portfolio page all have similar layouts that gives the users a sense of familiarity when visiting each page, which is a good thing in terms of the user experience of the visitors. 

Something I could work on more though, is the portfolio page. In each section consisting of the different games I’ve made, I have two buttons, a button that directs users to my GitHub page and the other that directs players to YouTube (I used this because I don’t actually have videos showing the demo of the game). For my next build, I would like to incorporate some videos that show players how to play the game or a quick preview of the game and perhaps add in a link where they can download the games. I feel that this would actually mimic an actual website and allow the players more options in terms of what they can do with that portfolio page. They can either just watch the video or leave it at that, but if the game is intriguing to them, they have the option to download them too, which would be pretty cool.
<br>
In addition to areas that I could potentially fix, I would say that the blog section is one of them. In terms of the pages that include my blog posts, I could rearrange that or totally style it differently in a manner where it doesn’t look like it would be a mission reading the entire blog post. I’m just really not satisfied with that section, and I believe some work could be done.


<br><br>
Media Queries 
<br>
I haven’t really paid attention to the different screen sizes for this website at all. I’m not really sure what my problem is here, am I too afraid to get stuck while executing this task or am I too lazy. The issue is I always leave this for last and always forget to do it as I end up rushing for time. I will have to work on this in my next assignment. 

<br> <br>
 Conclusion
 <br>

 Overall, I’m not too ashamed in regard to this site. I just feel like I can do better, but I spend so much time trying to perfect something else or change it entirely, that I forget that I have other aspects of this website that I need to complete. I still have a lot to work on, as one can see, however I’m not too discouraged. I feel that I’ve put so much pressure to have a fully functional website with no mistakes, where t stunts my motivation to actually carry on with work. I feel like from here onwards, I should appreciate what I have done right and not continuously fixate on what I have done wrong. I hope I remember that for the next assignment.
