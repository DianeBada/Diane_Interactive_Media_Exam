    <a href="#" class = "p-summary">The Medium is the Message. Wait, is it really?</a>
    <p class = "p-summary">It’s no doubt that the media has evolved over the centuries. From print, to radio, to television and now, the internet.<br> Each of these mediums have their own characteristics, much like the people who use them. This reverberates with McLuhan’s comments, “the medium is the message, is the personal and social consequences of any medium–that is an extension of ourselves–result from a new scale that is introduced into our affairs by each extension of ourselves or by new technology”.<br>

    <p class = "p-summary">A browser is an application program that facilitates in interacting with all content that is present on the World Wide Web. The WWW is a combination of all resources and users on the internet that are connected using Hypertext. A web browser is a client program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The role of an HTTP is that it makes requests to the servers throughout the internet on behalf of the browser user. </p>

<p class = "p-summary">
    The term interactivity can be described as the process of allowing information to be passed with no breaks in both directions between a computer/device and the person who uses it. This term derived from the Oxford dictionary describes the usual occurrence that everyone goes through today. Interactivity is always taking place, whether we are posting on social media, watching a music video on YouTube, or just simply interacting with the internet.    <br>
